# The Asset Manager Maslow Pyramid

The **Maslow Pyramid**, a concept introduced by psychologist Abraham Maslow in his 1943 paper “A Theory of Human Motivation,” is a psychological framework that outlines the hierarchical needs of human beings, starting from the most basic physiological needs to the highest level of self-actualization. This pyramid has been instrumental in various fields, including business, education, and personal development, for understanding and prioritizing needs.

**Did you know that the idea was initially met with skepticism?** Maslow himself faced criticism from peers who argued that human motivation could not be so neatly categorized. However, over time, the pyramid has gained widespread acceptance and is now a cornerstone in the study of human behavior.

I **introduced the concept** at [Prescinto, Inc.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/prescinto/), during a past company gathering in **Bangalore**. By applying this age-old concept to the realm of renewable energy asset management, we sparked insightful conversations that have since guided our approach to product development and client satisfaction. The analogy has become so influential that it is now kind of legendary within our company, with some even renaming it the **Gomez-Maslow Pyramid**.

Our version of the Maslow Pyramid for asset managers **starts with the basics** and moves towards more advanced needs. For a renewable energy asset manager, the journey begins with ensuring the fundamental requirements are met—like fast support, basic onboarding, and visualization. Once these are in place, they can focus on more sophisticated needs such as **predictive operations and AI recommendations**.

This approach underscores **my core belief**: before delving into advanced solutions, it’s crucial to master the essentials. Same idea I emphasized on [My 10-years experience selling B2B SaaS.](/my-10-years-experience-selling-B2B-SaaS/) (**focus focus focus on the basic non-sexy useful and easy to use stuff that pays off money**)

> Asset managers cannot fully leverage advanced technologies without a solid foundation.

Just as Maslow’s theory suggests that individuals cannot achieve higher-level fulfillment without first securing their basic needs, **asset managers cannot fully leverage advanced technologies without a solid foundation**. It’s tempting to chase the latest trends and technologies, but true success lies in ensuring that the fundamental needs are robustly addressed.

By aligning our services with this hierarchy of needs, we ensure that our clients—renewable energy asset managers—achieve **optimal satisfaction and efficiency**. This methodical approach not only enhances their performance but also solidifies our role as a **trusted partner** in their journey towards innovation and excellence.
